Kinship Verification
====================

Author: Zhicong Chen (Northeastern University, US)

This is my master's project.

### Development Environment
+ Programming: C++ (for algorithm implementation and calculation), Python (for websit back-end), javascript (for website front-end)
+ Image processing: Opencv 2.4 (C++), Jcrop (image crop in front-end)
+ Website frame: webpy (python)
+ xml processing: TinyXML2 (C++)

### C++ 11
For convenience, the marjor version 0, will use some C++ 11 new feature and functions, and marjorly base on linux environment, thus it will only be compatalbe with g++ 4.7 and linux environment.

Other supplies will be added after the orignal done.
